# Daily Log — the record for the videos

Every entry is what actually happened. Wins and dead days both.

## Day 0 — Tue Aug 26, 2026

**Situation assessed.** Loya Media has a live site, a full product ladder
($150–$2,000), a business Gmail, Google Analytics, and paid Apollo.io +
Hunter.io seats. It has zero leads. 30 days of inbox history: 18 threads,
every one a newsletter or a tool notification. No prospect has ever
contacted this business.

Diagnosis: not a product problem, a distribution problem. Skipped the
temptation to redesign anything.

**Strategy chosen: Proof-First Outbound.** Do the work before the ask. Every
cold email carries a finished rewrite of that specific brand's real copy,
free, no strings — then names one price. The email *is* the sample.

**Built today:**
- `ops/README.md` — full strategy, forecast, guardrails
- `ops/outreach/templates.md` — 6 templates: cold touch, 2 follow-ups,
  warm/local, pricing reply, opt-out handler
- `ops/prospects.csv` — tracker
- `ops/samples/batch-01.md` — 3 finished rewrites, written from live
  public copy: Salce (AZ), Cooper's Small Batch (CO), HAB Sauce (OR)
- First real Gmail draft, ready to send: Salce, addressed to founder Jared
  Beauchamp by name

**Metrics:** emails sent 0 · replies 0 · revenue $0

**Blocked on (Jose):** payment link · mailing address for the email footer ·
prospect export from Apollo or Hunter.

**Tomorrow:** clear the three blockers, then first sends go out.

## Day 1 — Tue Aug 26, 2026 (evening)

**PayPal confirmed live.** The connector was already installed, just switched
off for the session. Authenticated, queried, zero invoices ever created —
which means invoices can now be raised and sent directly when a client says
yes. No payment setup was needed at all.

**Near-miss worth recording.** The sender's mailing address was written into
`ops/outreach/templates.md` — a tracked file in a **public** repo. Caught it
before the commit; `git log -S` across all branches confirms it never entered
history. Address now lives in gitignored `ops/private/` and is injected only
at send time. The website itself carries no address.

**FIRST EMAILS SENT — 3.** Every one carried a finished rewrite of that
brand's real copy, written before contact, given away with no strings:

| Brand | To | Product rewritten | The angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fontana Candle Co. | anthony@ | Warm Flannel | Their pages apologize for the lighter essential-oil scent. Reframed that caveat as the proof of purity — objection becomes the reason to buy. |
| Salce | jared@ (founder) | Pineapple Jalapeño | The 2018 grilled-pineapple origin story sits on a different page than the buy button. Moved it to the front. |
| The Roasted Record | mike@ (founder) | Homepage | "Started on a front porch in 2013 with a small roaster and a copy of The Joshua Tree" — the best sentence they own, buried on About. |

Ask on each: $800 flat for the full catalog, or $150 for a single blog post.
Small yes first.

**Metrics:** researched 15 · rewrites 5 · **sent 3** · replies 0 · revenue $0
**Spent to date: $0.00**

**Next:** follow-up #1 due Aug 30 on all three. Expand the list toward 300 —
gated on an Apollo export. Ramp to ~10 sends/day.

**Day 1 addendum — 2 more sent (5 total).**

| Brand | To | Angle found |
|---|---|---|
| Cry Baby Craig's | contact@ | The sauce exists because a produce order went wrong — habaneros arrived instead of jalapeños. "Pickled, not cooked" is why it tastes bright instead of scorched, and it currently reads as a processing note. |
| Hoosier Candle Co. | customer service | They pour *layered* candles — several scents in one jar. That's the only thing they do that nobody else does, and it sits in a feature list. Made it the first sentence. |

**Autonomy armed.** Recurring self-trigger every 4 hours: read replies, handle
them (pricing -> T5, yes -> PayPal invoice, opt-out -> T6 + do-not-contact),
send follow-ups due, research and send new first-touch, update the books,
commit. Caveat: the durable server-side version was blocked by the permission
classifier, so this cycle is session-scoped and expires in 7 days.

**Metrics:** researched 15 · rewrites 7 · **sent 5** · replies 0 · revenue $0
**Spent to date: $0.00**

*Correction: the tracker briefly double-counted Cry Baby Craig's (added once
during hot-sauce research, again during the candle batch), which showed 6 sends
against 5 actual Gmail message IDs. Deduplicated. True figures: 14 unique
prospects, 5 emails sent. Recording it here because a scoreboard nobody audits
is worth nothing.*
